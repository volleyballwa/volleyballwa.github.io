1. Create a "Unique Team" identifier so that teams can be created with the same name (but in multiple divisions / genders)
    a. maybe this is division + " " + team ?

2. Add a way (new page??) to generate "individual" scoresheets.
    - Select Event
    - Select Date
        - Venue (optional)
        - Court (optional)
        - Start time (+ timeslot) (Optional)
            - This will select all games that start from the timeslot onwards
    - Scoresheet Type (pick list)

3. Generate team and coach lists from the rosters report, instead of from the athletes report
